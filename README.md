# Web API Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for building a web API using Clojure. It provides a foundation for creating RESTful APIs with clean architecture and efficient handling of HTTP requests.

## Dependencies

- **org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"**: The core Clojure library.
- **compojure "1.6.1"**: A concise routing library for Ring/Clojure.
- **http-kit "2.3.0"**: An efficient, low-latency HTTP server/client library for Clojure.
- **com.stuartsierra/dependency "1.0.0"** and **com.stuartsierra/component "1.1.0"**: Libraries for managing dependencies and building component-based systems, respectively.
- **ring/ring-defaults "0.3.2"**: Ring middleware defaults for common settings.
- **ring/ring-mock "0.4.0"** and **ring-mock "0.1.5"**: Libraries for mocking Ring requests and responses in tests.
- **prismatic/schema "1.4.1"**: A library for defining data schemas and validating data.
- **clj-http "3.12.3"**: A simple HTTP client for Clojure.
- **state-flow-helpers/state-flow-helpers "0.1.0-XABLAW"** and **nubank/state-flow "5.14.5"**: Libraries for managing state and flow control in applications.

## Features

- **Routing with Compojure**: Define routes using Compojure's concise syntax.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Organize your application into modular components for better maintainability and testability.
- **Schema Validation**: Use Prismatic Schema to define data schemas and validate incoming requests and outgoing responses.
- **HTTP Server**: Run your API using the efficient HTTP server provided by http-kit.
- **Middleware**: Leverage Ring middleware for handling common tasks such as JSON parsing, exception handling, and CORS.
- **Mocking**: Easily mock HTTP requests and responses for testing purposes using ring-mock.
- **HTTP Client**: Interact with external APIs using the clj-http library.
- **State Management**: Utilize state-flow libraries for managing application state and controlling flow.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-api.git
   ```
2. Run the tests
   ```
   lein test
   ```
3. Install Leiningen if you haven't already:

   ```
   # For macOS/Linux
   brew install leiningen
   
   # For Windows
   scoop install leiningen
   ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd your-api
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```
   lein run
   ```

6. Access your API at `http://localhost:3004`.
